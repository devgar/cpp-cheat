    stream Input and Output

    # stream

        An stream is an abstraction over different input/output methods
        such as regular files, stdin/stdout/stderr (pipes in linux), etc.
        so that all of them can be treated on an uniform basis once you opened the stream.

        Most functions have a form which outputs only to stdout,
        and most input functions have a form which reads only from sdtin
        coupled with a general form that outputs to any stream.

        Unfortunatelly, sometimes there are subtle differences between those two
        forms, so beawere!

    # FILE

        FILE is a macro that represents a stream object.

        Its name is FILE of course because files are one of the main types of streams.

        However, streams can represent other resources in the filesystem in general
        such as Linux FIFOs or sockets.

    # stream vs file descriptors

        A file descriptor is a POSIX concept and thus shall not be discussed here.

        EOF is a C concept.

        EOF works because there are only 256 bytes you can get from an fd
        so EOF is just some int outside of the possible 0-255 range, tipically -1

        In Linux for example, EOF does not exist.

        The only way to know if a file is over is to make a `sys_read` call
        and check if you get 0 bytes.

        Since `sys_read` returns the number of bytes read, if we get less than we asked for
        this means that the file is over.

        In case more data could become available in the future, for example on a pipe,
        `sys_read` does not return immediately, and the reader sleeps until that data becomes available.

    # File streams

            Open file for read/write

            Don't forget to fclose after using! open streams are a process resource.

            Modes:

            -   `r`: read. compatible with a,w

            -   `w`: read and write. destroy if exists, create if not.

            -   `a`: append. write to the end. creates if does not exist.

            -   `+`: can do both input and output. msut use flush or fseek

            -   `x`: don't destroy if exist (c11, not c++!)

            -   `b`: binary.

                Means nothing in POSIX systems.

                On our dear DOS/Windows and Mac OS X, automatically converts between \n and \n\r or \r.
                http://stackoverflow.com/questions/229924/difference-between-files-writen-in-binary-and-text-mode

                Windows also does trailing \z magic for ultra backwards compatibility.

                Therefore for portability, always use this when you are going to do IO
                with binary IO functions such as fwrite.

            In case of error:

            - return `NULL` and set `errno`.

        # Text IO vs Binary IO

            # Text vs binary for numerical types

                Example: an int 123 can be written to a file in two ways:

                - text: three bytes containing the ascii values of `1`, `2` and then `3`
                - binary: as the internal int representation of the c value, that is 4 bytes, with `123` in binary and zeroes at the front.

                Advantages of text:

                - it is human readable since it contains only ASCII or UTF values
                - for small values it may be more efficient (123 is 3 bytes in ascii instead of 4 in binary)
                - it is portable across multiple systems, while binary varies, especially byte ordering.

                Advantages of binary:

                - it much shorter for large integers
                - inevitable for data that cannot be interpretred as text (images, executables)

            # Newline vs carriage return newline

                Newline carriage return realated TODO confirm

                For portability, use it consistently.

                In linux the difference between text methods and binary methods is only conceptual:
                some methods output human readable text (`fprintf`) and can be classified as text,
                while others output binary, no difference is made at file opening time.

        # fclose

            Don't forget to close because:

            - open `FILE*` are a program resource
            - close also flushes

            In case of error:

            - return `EOF`
            - set `errno`
